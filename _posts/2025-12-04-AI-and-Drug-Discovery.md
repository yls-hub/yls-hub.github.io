News about AI transforming drug discovery is everywhere. Headlines paint a picture of novel molecules emerging from labs at unprecedented speed, pharmaceutical giants investing billions within a few years instead of decades, and patients—once at the mercy of fatal diseases—placing hope in the power of AI.

From what I’ve observed, most applications focus on large-scale data screening and analysis, generating new chemical structures, and modeling drug profiles such as toxicity or binding affinity. But I wanted a more concrete example—and that’s when **AlphaFold** came up.

AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind (a Google subsidiary) in 2018, tackles one of biology’s grand challenges: predicting how proteins fold into their 3D structures. Proteins are the building blocks of life—chains of amino acids that form skin, bones, enzymes, and hormones. Understanding their structure helps scientists uncover why diseases occur and how to fix them.

Take **Alzheimer’s disease**: Amyloids are protein fragments that normally support communication and immune response. But when certain proteins, like Amyloid-Beta, misfold or aggregate, they damage brain function. Traditionally, predicting protein folds required brute-force computation, testing countless shapes—a process that could take weeks or months. AlphaFold now delivers these predictions in seconds. For Alzheimer’s, it can model how Amyloid misfolds and identify binding sites, guiding the design of molecules that stabilize protein folding and prevent harmful aggregation.

Since its release, AlphaFold has contributed over 200 million protein structures and made its core code open source. DeepMind is now developing AlphaFold 3, expanding beyond proteins to include DNA, RNA, and ligands—essentially all molecules of life.

Sounds like a historical moment, no? Imagine a future where researchers hold a complete map of the human proteome—an achievement as transformative as the Human Genome Project. Such a milestone would not only catalog the architecture of life but also unlock the ability to probe the subtle variations and dynamics of each protein. These nuances could become the keys to precision medicine, enabling therapies tailored to individual molecular profiles. From neurology to oncology, the implications are profound: faster drug development, targeted interventions, and a deeper understanding of disease at its most fundamental level. 

Of course, Google isn’t doing this purely for science. To capture commercial potential, DeepMind launched **Isomorphic Labs**, a spin-off focused on AI-driven drug discovery. Isomorphic Labs raised $600 million in Series D funding in March 2025, pushing its valuation into the multibillion-dollar range. Its partners include major pharma players like Novartis and Eli Lilly.

While the basic AlphaFold version is open source, advanced features and specialized enhancements require licensing. Revenue streams include:
*	Customized modeling and predictions, charged as one-time fees or royalties.
*	Licensing specialized versions for commercial use.
*	Collaborative drug design projects with big pharma, leveraging AlphaFold predictions to accelerate development.

AlphaFold stands as a prime example of how AI is reshaping drug discovery. For those without a scientific background, it offers a tangible, real-world illustration of AI’s potential in life sciences. I’m excited to follow its evolution and see how it continues to push the boundaries of medicine and research.
