No industry rivals Tech today when it comes to financing and investment decisions. AI as the driving force is staggering—Big Tech alone is projected to spend $400 billion in 2025, roughly equivalent to Vietnam’s entire GDP. How do they fund such astronomical bills? Cost-cutting and layoffs help ease short-term cash pressure, but compared to trillion-dollar ambitions, those savings are negligible. The real lever is financing: traditional debt instruments like corporate bonds, coupled with innovative agreements with private investors and funds, pulling the entire market along for the ride.

Take Oracle as an example. Yesterday, I read that its shares have dropped more than 25% in a month—a surprising turn given the AI boom and the September buzz when Larry Ellison’s wealth surged $101 billion overnight after the OpenAI deal. So what changed? Oracle’s core business is cloud solutions for ERP and databases, but its growth strategy now hinges on becoming the No.1 data center operator—a classic Big Tech play. The catch? They’re betting heavily on one customer: OpenAI. About 65% of Oracle’s revenue forecast depends on a $300 billion computing power agreement over five years, with limited upfront revenue. Isn’t that risky, considering OpenAI is still a startup and may not be as profitable as many assume (check out this [post])?

Oracle’s financials reflect investor concerns. Over the past year, its long-term debt ballooned to $96 billion, and it spent more cash than it generated on AI infrastructure. In fact, it’s the only Big Tech player this year with negative free cash flow. Yet, Oracle plans to raise another $38 billion in debt to keep financing AI. In Corporate Finance, we learn to base investment decisions on growth prospects, cash flow, and financing risk. From every angle, Oracle appears to be going all-in—despite bleeding cash. The financing risk is enormous given the debt load and uncertain interest rates. If cash flow doesn’t improve and confidence in the AI boom falters, Oracle could become a prime target for short sellers.
