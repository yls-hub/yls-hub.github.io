The last post explored the background of antibiotics. The alarming reality: _antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050 and $3 trillion in global GDP losses per year by 2030_ points to an urgent need for new drug discovery. With such a vast patient base and global market, one would expect major innovation and competition. **The reality is the opposite**.

Since the 2010s, big pharma has largely abandoned antibiotics and even infectious diseases as a whole: Pfizer exited antibiotic pre-clinical research in 2011; AstraZeneca spun out all antibiotic assets; Allergan, Sanofi, and Novartis pulled out in 2018.

Today, only GSK and Roche retain antibiotic assets—Roche has just 1 out of 122 pipeline assets, while GSK’s infectious disease portfolio is mostly vaccines.

The financing community shares this pessimism. Between 2018–2023, private investment in antibiotics totaled $1.2B—42 times less than oncology.

The reasons for exiting are multifaceted but largely boil down to economic returns – how fast and how much the company can recover the initial investment. A recent estimate shows that a new antibiotic needs $300M in annual revenue to be sustainable, yet most earn $15M–$50M per year. Developing antibiotics is tricker than other drugs:

I.	**Drug discovery**: discoverying and validating an antibiotics is harder. Bacteria evolve rapidly, often becoming resistant during development.  
II.	**Clinical Trials**: trials aim for “non-inferiority” to existing treatments, requiring costly comparisons to multiple standards of care. For drugs targeting deadly pathogens, patient enrollment is a challenge.  
III.	**Pricing**: Antibiotics have weak pricing power. They must remain widely accessible and face strict cost-effectiveness scrutiny. QALY-based pricing shows stark contrast: $900K for an anti-cancer orphan drug vs. $2K for a novel antibiotic.  
IV.	**Sales Volume**: Treatment lasts 1–2 weeks, unlike chronic therapies. Stewardship programs reserve new antibiotics as last-resort options—good for public health, bad for business.

The world is running a tough race against bacterial infections on mortality and morbidity with diminishing number of effective drugs. Luckily we still see that biotech, SMEs, and academia continue innovating, but success is far from guaranteed. Allecra’s Exblifeb (approved in 2024 for cUTIs) couldn’t generate enough sales and went bankrupt in 2025. Another biotech Tetraphase which brought Xerava to the market was sold in 2020 due to substantial losses despite over a decade of effort of bring the drug to the market in 2018.

Without more government and regulatory intervention to incentivize innovation and stabilize this “broken market,” we risk losing the race against AMR.
