Antibiotics are deeply embedded in everyday life. Recently, I overheard colleagues discussing doctors prescribing antibiotics to children for fevers—a common scenario. For many, the story ends with “antibiotics treat infections.” But the reality is far more complex.

Our bodies are constantly exposed to bacteria. From head to toe, any part can become infected—ranging from mild skin infections to severe conditions like meningitis or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The severity often depends on the strength and type of bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria, for example, have a thick outer membrane, making them harder to kill.

So, how do antibiotics work? They target bacteria through several key mechanisms:

**I. Inhibition of Cell Wall Synthesis**
This is the oldest and most iconic mechanism, inspiring the discovery of Penicillin, a major beta-lactam antibiotic. By preventing bacteria from forming cell walls, these drugs cause bacterial death.

**II. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis**
Antibiotics such as Tetracyclines, Macrolides, and Streptogramins bind to bacterial ribosomal subunits, halting protein chain formation and stopping growth.

**III. Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis**
Drugs like Quinolones interfere with DNA replication and transcription, preventing bacteria from reproducing or repairing themselves.

**IV. Disruption of Cytoplasmic Membrane**
Agents such as Polymyxins alter membrane permeability, causing essential intracellular ions to leak out—leading to bacterial death.

The progress in antibiotic development during the last century has been remarkable. New mechanism and varieties were discovered every 5-10 years.

However, epidemiological data reveal a worrying trend: antibiotic resistance is rising globally. One study finds that global consumption increased by **16%** from 2016 to 2023, reaching 34 billion defined daily doses. ECDC, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, reports a statistically significant rise in antibiotic use in both primary care and hospitals between 2020 and 2024. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics accelerate this process, creating stronger bacteria, more untreatable infections, and higher mortality rates.  Resistant bacteria multiply rapidly, share resistance genes, and even produce enzymes that destroy antibiotics. The phrase “What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger” perfectly describes this phenomenon.

The impact is severe. Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report 2025 shows that antimicrobial resistance accounts for millions of deaths annually, particularly in bloodstream infections—the deadliest category. Common pathogens such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae show resistance rates exceeding 40%, driving the highest mortality burden.

With so many unmet medical needs, the question arises: What does the pipeline of new antibiotics look like? Is the commercial outlook for developing stronger drugs to combat this public health crisis promising—or bleak?
